	/**
	 * Start playing an animation montage on the avatar actor and wait for it to finish
	 * If StopWhenAbilityEnds is true, this montage will be aborted if the ability ends normally. It is always stopped when the ability is explicitly cancelled.
	 * On normal execution, OnBlendOut is called when the montage is blending out, and OnCompleted when it is completely done playing
	 * OnInterrupted is called if another montage overwrites this, and OnCancelled is called if the ability or task is cancelled
	 *
	 * @param TaskInstanceName Set to override the name of this task, for later querying
	 * @param MontageToPlay The montage to play on the character
	 * @param Rate Change to play the montage faster or slower
	 * @param StartSection If not empty, named montage section to start from
	 * @param bStopWhenAbilityEnds If true, this montage will be aborted if the ability ends normally. It is always stopped when the ability is explicitly cancelled
	 * @param AnimRootMotionTranslationScale Change to modify size of root motion or set to 0 to block it entirely
	 * @param StartTimeSeconds Starting time offset in montage, this will be overridden by StartSection if that is also set
	 * @param bAllowInterruptAfterBlendOut If true, you can receive OnInterrupted after an OnBlendOut started (otherwise OnInterrupted will not fire when interrupted, but you will not get OnComplete).
